# Task Management AI tool

The primary objective of this capstone project is to substantially enhance the task distribution process within a team structure. This enhancement is designed with the specific intention of promoting not just the prompt delivery of project components, but also significantly mitigating stress levels within the team while ensuring the achievement of critical project milestones.

In order to effectively implement this process, a key strategy we propose is the division of a large project deliverable into more manageable and smaller parts. This approach is not only more efficient but also allows for a more streamlined integration of tasks into the daily work routine of each team member.

The overarching goal here is to amplify group efficiency by ensuring that each team member's work schedule is optimized. This optimization will not only guarantee the completion of individual tasks but will also ensure that the entire team is making consistent progress towards the project's overarching objectives.

Moreover, this system of efficient task distribution and careful integration into the team's daily routine will create a mechanism that keeps the entire group on track. This not only fosters a sense of shared responsibility and commitment but also ensures the successful and timely completion of the project.

## Key Objectives for the Project:

For this project, we aim to accomplish several significant objectives to enhance task management and distribution within team structures:

1. **Information Extraction from PDF Documents:** One of our primary objectives is to extract crucial information such as project deliverables, the weightage of assignments, the description of tasks, and the scoring criteria from PDF documents. This will help in better understanding the tasks, their importance, and the criteria for successful completion.
2. **Task Classification and Timeline Assignment:** We aim to classify tasks and allocate suitable timelines for each one. This will be accomplished by using a combination of the task description, the potential steps involved in reaching the milestone, and the marks associated with the task. By doing so, we will be able to establish a clear roadmap for each task, thereby facilitating smoother execution.
3. **Sub-task Suggestion Feature Development:** We plan to develop a sub-task suggestion feature. In this, the larger deliverables will be further divided into smaller, more manageable tasks based on the task description. This will allow us to keep track of each task in accordance with its timeline and urgency, thus ensuring that no task or subtask is overlooked or delayed.
4. **Integration with Team Members' Calendars:** Finally, we intend to integrate our system with the calendars of individual team members. This will enable automatic allocation of tasks or sub-tasks to team members based on their indicated availability. This feature will ensure that each task is being actively worked on, and helps to maintain the momentum of the project.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to enhance the efficiency of task distribution, promote a sense of shared responsibility, and ensure the successful and timely completion of the project.
